# simple-multivariate-logistic-regression
This repository contains the code and datasets to be used for a simple logistic regression which categorizes data under 4 different labels.

In this we have over 7-8 variables in the datasets which determine the overall outcome into 4 different categories namely 0, 1, 2 and 3. We can be using any such labels depending on the requirements.

For this project, we have used numpy and scitik learn libraries and imported their functions for making our tasks easier.
